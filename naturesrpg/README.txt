This is v1 of the Nature's RPG Django app. It has very limited functionality and is a work in progress.

Included is the actual project directory(natures-rpg/) along with two apps(frontend and backend).

To run, type "pip install -r requirements.txt" and then "python manage.py runserver"app.

Once this is done, you can visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the temporary home page or
http://127.0.0.1:8000/login to view the "login" page.
